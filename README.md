##Personal Learning
This project started off difficult as getting used to Wordpress and how it works was extremely challenging. However, after gaining a better understanding of the template hierarchy, it became much clearer and I actually quite enjoyed building this Wordpress website. It was also very neat to see all the different available plugins that Wordpress offers to make coding more convenient and easier. 

##TODO
 * CSS some more
 * Clean up codes/SASS it up 
 * Clean up codes with variables/mixins
 * Implement phone call and email function for 'Contact Info'
